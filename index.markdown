I've been using a Canon P-150 document scanner for a couple of years now to go paperless. I've written about the process before and it's working very well for me.

In January this year, Canon introduced the WU10 WiFi adapter for the P-series scanners, along with an iOS app called Canon Capture On Touch Mobile. I couldn't find any reviews on the web, so I decided to take the plunge and buy one. Here's my take.

WHAT IT IS

The WU10 is a wifi bridge to control the Canon P-series desktop scanners. I have the P-150, now discontinued, and the WU10 also works with the current P-215 and P-208 Mobile scanners.

The WU10 is a plastic box with a USB socket and a power plug. You connect it to power and plug the scanner into the box over USB. The WU10 also contains a rechargeable battery which is charged by the mains cord but which can also power the unit itself and the scanner for mobile operation.

WIFI SETUP

The WU10 has two modes of wifi operation: it can connect to your existing wifi network, or it can become its own hotspot for ad-hoc operation. The wifi mode is selected by a switch on the side of the box and you have to restart the unit before it will change modes.

To set the device up, you start it in ad-hoc mode and connect to its SSID. From there, you can connect to a web-based configuration portal on the device via its IP address and enter the SSID and password for your existing WiFi network. Switch modes, restart the device and it's on your network and ready to scan. The configuration portal supports five different WiFi network setups so you can set it up for home and work. In the portal, you can also configure WiFi settings for the device's own hotspot, including 2.4GHz channels, 20/40MHz channels and change the SSID and key that it uses.

MAC SCANNING

Once you've set up the device on your network, you can immediately scan from the iOS apps - more on that later. The Mac software "CaptureOnTouch" that came with the scanner is not included or updated with the WU10.
